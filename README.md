The program will be divided into two parts ,1 will be maze generating and the next will be maze solving.
The various approach which i will take will be uploaded as time passes.

Day 2:
I have added the portion where the walls of the two cells delete their respective walls in order to create a set path. There may be some errors in the code which will be looked at during post processing.

Day 3 & 4:
 The indexing of he lists were challenging ,as i had to go through hours of debugging,writing down the working of my loop in my note book.The python turtle module bit was done with the help of chat gpt.I got assisted on where to draw lines and how long to make those lines.Day 5 will now be dedicated on creaking an algorithm to solve the created maze,the concept of recursion will be used.
