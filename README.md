The program will be divided into two parts ,1 will be maze generating and the next will be maze solving.
The various approach which i will take will be uploaded as time passes.

Day 2:
I have added the portion where the walls of the two cells delete their respective walls in order to create a set path. There may be some errors in the code which will be looked at during post processing.

Day 3 & 4:
 The indexing of he lists were challenging ,as i had to go through hours of debugging,writing down the working of my loop in my note book.The python turtle module bit was done with the help of chat gpt.I got assisted on where to draw lines and how long to make those lines.Day 5 will now be dedicated on creaking an algorithm to solve the created maze,the concept of recursion will be used. 

Day5:
The back tracking algorithm was done,as it included checking the previous node ,and follwoing the way back,the onlu thing remaining is to print the final path of the maze,this also includes checking it the algorith morks properly or not.This concludes the 75% progress of the project ,as the remaining 25% will include printing the path and debudding any error that may come along the way.
